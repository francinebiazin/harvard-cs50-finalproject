# Harvard CS50 Final Project: Rehydrate then Celebrate!
I took Harvard's CS50 course on edX and for our final project, David Malan asked us to "build something of interest to you, that you solve an actual problem, that you impact your community, or that you change the world". What a tall drink of water of an ask!

### Have you been drinking enough water?

Health experts advise that we should be drinking at least 8 glasses of water a day (about 2 litres) because every cell in your body needs it to function properly.

Drinking enough water boosts our metabolisms, improves skin condition, cures some headaches, improves concentration, helps the immune system, improves digestion, increases energy levels, helps us exercise better, and quite frankly just makes us happier.

"[So let's start drinking more water right now!](http://fbiazin.pythonanywhere.com/)"
